The **Appraisals** app uses a preconfigured default template that is general enough to apply to all
employees. If desired, the default template :ref:`can be modified <appraisals/modify-template>`. If
different templates are needed, such as department-specific appraisal templates, new templates
:ref:`can be created <appraisals/create-template>`.

.. _appraisals/modify-template:

Modify appraisal templates
==========================

If needed, changes can be made to the default template. To view the default template, navigate to
:menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Configuration --> Appraisal Templates`.

The default template appears in a list view, named :guilabel:`Default`. Click the template to view
its details. Make any desired changes to the template.

The default template consists of the following questions:

.. _appraisals/create-template:

Create appraisal templates
==========================

Large companies with many departments may prefer department-specific appraisal templates rather than
a universal default template. Creating and using department-specific templates can be helpful if
specific feedback is needed.

.. example::
   An appliance repair company has two main types of employees: office workers who handle
   administrative tasks and scheduling, and field repair technicians who perform repairs at
   customers' homes.

   This type of company may create two different appraisal templates, one for the office workers and
   one for the on-site repair technicians.

To create a new appraisal template, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app --> Configuration -->
Appraisal Templates` and click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner. Next, configure
the appraisal by :doc:`adding questions to the template using the rich-text editor
<../../essentials/html_editor>`.

Additionally, a new appraisal template can be created by duplicating the default template and
modifying the copy. To duplicate the template, navigate to :menuselection:`Appraisals app -->
Configuration --> Appraisal Templates`, then click on the template being duplicated. Click the
:icon:`fa-gear` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon, then click :icon:`fa-clone` :guilabel:`Duplicate`.

First, rename the template, then make any desired changes.

.. important::
   Appraisal templates are housed in the **Surveys** app. Any appraisal template created *in* the
   **Appraisals** app must be configured to be used with the **Appraisals** app, or it will *not* be
   available for appraisals.

   To ensure a new template is available for the **Appraisals** app, navigate to the **Surveys**
   app, and click on the appraisal template.

   Tick the radio button next to :guilabel:`Appraisal` at the top of the survey. This setting allows
   the survey to be used in the **Appraisals** app, and is visible in the :guilabel:`Appraisal
   Template` drop-down menu.
